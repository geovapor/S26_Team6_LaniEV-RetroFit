## Introduction - Landon

The introduction must be the opening section of the proposal. It acts as the "elevator pitch" of the project, briefly introducing the objective, its importance, and the proposed solution. Because readers may only read this section, it should effectively capture their attention and encourage them to read further.

Toward the end of the introduction, include a subsection that outlines what the proposal will cover. This helps set reader expectations for the ensuing sections.


## Formulating the Problem - Parker + Alec

Formulating the problem or objective involves clearly defining it through background information, specifications, and constraints. Think of it as "fencing in" the objective to make it unambiguously clear what is and is not being addressed and why.

Questions to consider:
- Who does the problem affect (i.e. who is your customer)? 
    This solution targets owners of electric golf cars who wish to supplement their vehicle’s power supply through solar energy, eliminating dependence on traditional outlet-based charging. The intended customer is any electric golf car owner seeking a more autonomous and flexible charging solution.
  
- Why do we need this solution? 
    This solution addresses a critical gap in usability – when a golf car’s battery is depleted during active use and no electrical outlet is accessible, the vehicle becomes inoperable. By integrating a solar charging panel, the car can passively recharge while stationary and exposed to sunlight, extending operational range and reducing downtime without requiring access to traditional charging infrastructure.
  
- What challenges necessitate a dedicated, multi-person engineering team?   
    Several factors make a multi-person engineering team essential. First, safety oversight cannot be managed by a single individual who is simultaneously performing hands-on-testing – a dedicated team member should always monitor for hazards. Second, the system comprises multiple distinct subsystems, each requiring specialized technical knowledge that no single engineer is likely to possess across all areas. Third, live testing demands the simultaneous collection of data across multiple points in the system, which is physically impossible for one person to manage alone.
  
- Why aren’t off-the-shelf solutions sufficient? 
    While prior attempts have been made to develop a comparable solution, none have proven successful or reliable. Existing commercial products lack the specific compatibility, performance validation, and system integration required for this application, making a purpose-built, thoroughly tested solution necessary. 

### Background

**Provide context and details necessary to define the problem clearly and delineate its boundaries.**
#### Customer
This project's primary customer is Lani Solar, LLC (LaniEV). LaniEV is developing a line of standardized retrofit conversion kits for low-speed electric vehicles (LSVs), personal transport vehicles (PVTs),  and golf cars. These retrofit kits replace the legacy lead-acid battery with a LiFePO₄ (Lithium Iron Phosphate) battery bank integrated with a self-charging roof solar panel. The goal is to commercialize the conversion kits for entire fleet conversions. Secondary stakeholders include Tennessee Technological University (TTU), as the owner of the control golf car used for the project, and as the ensuring agency for documented safety, reliability, and performance data. Dr. Christopher Storm Johnson is responsible, as the capstone instructor, for evaluating team performance and ensuring the project's desired end-state is reached. Prospective fleet operators and other consumers of the retrofit kit would depend heavily on the testing and evaluations done on the product. 

#### Problem
Legacy golf cars continue to utilize lead-acid battery systems due to their well-documented electrical performance and broad availability. These systems present constraints such as low energy density, volume constraints, short lifecycle, load limits, maintenance requirements, and environmental concerns. These limitations increase cost and decrease sustainability for large-scale applications. Alternative power systems, such as LiFePO₄ batteries integrated with solar charging, could potentially address the limitations inherent in the lead-acid batteries. The growing interest in alternative systems demands formal documentation for conversion processes. The lack of validation prevents large-scale migration of LSV, PVT, and golf car platforms to alternative energy systems.

#### Solution 
Meticulous examination and documentation of the conversion process shall establish a validated framework for implementing the standardized retrofit kit. The development includes initial state characterization of the existing lead-acid system, formalization of the conversion methodology, post-conversion performance evaluation, and a quantified analysis of environmental and economic impact. The Tennessee Tech University Club Car shall serve as the control platform for this process. Baseline electrical and functional characteristics of the legacy system shall be documented prior to conversion. Following installation of the LiFePO₄ battery and solar charging systems, the vehicle shall undergo structured testing to quantify energy efficiency, power delivery, charging behavior, and operational performance. The resulting documentation shall provide the necessary metrics required for the retrofit kit to be commercialized. 

#### Challenges
The transition from a legacy lead-acid battery system to a LiFePO₄ solar-integrated architecture introduces several technical challenges that require analysis and validation. Power system analysis is required to ensure electrical compatibility between the new battery management system, solar charge component, and existing drivetrain components. Reliable baseline and post-conversion measurements require appropriate instrumentation and data acquisition to produce a repeatable performance comparison. System modeling is necessary to interpret data and support cost and environmental impact projections. In addition, testing and documentation must be developed to establish a repeatable retrofit framework rather than an installation-specific modification.

#### Alternatives
The response to lead-acid battery degradation in golf cars has been, primarily, to replace the old battery with a new lead-acid battery. This approach minimizes integration complexity but does not address limitations related to energy density, cycle life, or environmental impact. A secondary alternative involves replacing the lead-acid battery bank with a LiFePO₄ system while preserving the grid-based charging. Although this method reduces maintenance requirements, it does not incorporate renewable energy or provide documented lifecycle comparisons. A less compact solution, still matching the footprint of the retrofit kit, would be the construction of a solar farm to fuel charging stations for golf cars. While a solar farm is less effective for small vehicles, it allows for more diverse applications of solar energy. Additional alternatives include full vehicle replacement or commercially available conversion kits. However, these options often lack formally documented integration procedures, validated performance data, and/or economic or environmental lifecycle analysis.

### Specifications and Constraints

Specifications and constraints define the system's requirements. They can be positive (do this) or negative (don't do that). They can be mandatory (shall or must) or optional (may). They can cover performance, accuracy, interfaces, or limitations. Regardless of their origin, they must be unambiguous and impose measurable requirements.

#### Specifications
- 1.1 **Initial Vehicle condition Report:**
    - They want photos, vehicle Id, current odometer reading, diagnostic summary and a narrative of the initial state. 1.2 Lead-Acid Baseline Specification Sheet: A technical sheet documenting total Battery bank weight, voltage/amp-hour rating, wiring diagram/schematic and terminal condition.

- 2.1 **Step-by-step Battery Conversion Manual Draft:**
    - A detailed documented procedure with (photos/illustrations) for the physical removal of the old bank and installation of the new single unit. 2.2 Post-Conversion Wiring Schematic: A labeled electrical diagram showing the final LiFePO4 unit connections, any necessary voltage reduction and associated safety protocols implemented.

- 2.3 **Solar Roof Installation Log:**
    - A sequential log and photo journal documenting the roof swap process, including weight change (Delta/Weight) and final panel mounting specifications. 

- 3.1 **Official Testing Protocol Document:**
    - A formal document detailing test variables, control groups, measurement tools, environmental constraints, and validation criteria for the "fill vs drain" test.

- 3.2 **Post conversion Performance Data log:**
    - Raw and processed data tables and performance graphs plotting solar charge rates vs. discharge rates (motor amp draw) across specified conditions.

- 5.2 **State-level Economic Extrapolation Report:**
    - A summary projecting the total ROI and cumulative net economic benefit for a hypothetical state-wide fleet conversion. 


#### Constraints

Constraints often stem from governing bodies, standards organizations, and broader considerations beyond the requirements set by stakeholders. Several regulatory bodies may govern aspects of this solution.

- **The National Electrical Code, Article 690:**    
    - Sets standards for solar photovoltaic systems and would apply to the electrical integration of the solar panel and charge controller .UL Additionally, if the golf car is intended for use on public roads or pathways, local Department of Motor Vehicles regulations or municipal ordinances may apply.[A]

- **OSHA regulations:**
    - It would also govern safe practices during live testing and assembly to protect team members working with electrical systems.[B],[C]

 - **Socially**
    - This solution democratizes access to reliable electric transportation in areas lacking adequate electrical infrastructure, which has meaningful implications in rural areas of developing communities where golf carts serve practical transportation roles beyond recreation. Culturally, the growing acceptance of solar technology and green energy solutions means this product aligns well with current consumer values and expectations around sustainability.[D]  

- **SAE International standards**
    - May also apply to the electrical integration of auxiliary power systems into electric vehicles. Adhering to these standards ensures the system performs predictably and safely across varying environmental conditions. The engineering and testing phases carry inherent electrical hazards, including risk of shock,short circuit or thermal runaway in battery systems, which is precisely why the project requires a dedicated safety monitor during live testing.[E] 

## Survey of Existing Solutions - Nathan
Research existing solutions, whether in literature, on the market, or within the industry. Present these findings in a coherent, organized manner. Remember to cite all information that is not common knowledge.

### Methods of Powering a Golf Car
There are multiple existing solutions to power a golf car. The oldest of these is the gas-powered golf car, which uses a combustion engine to propel the vehicle. According to Grand View Research (2024), gas-powered golf cars account for approximately 24.6% of the global golf car market, with electric models making up the remaining 75.4% [1].
The next solution is the electric-powered golf car, which is more prevalent in the golfing industry and uses different methods to power itself. The most common way to charge an electric golf car is to plug the battery into an outlet that feeds off the main power grid, which draws from many sources such as natural gas, renewables, nuclear, coal, and others. Another way electric golf cars are powered is through renewable energy sources such as solar panels. By attaching a solar panel to the roof of the golf car, the battery can be charged throughout the day, making it a better option than traditional golf cars in sunnier areas.

#### Comparison of golf cars
| Charging Type | Cost | Lifespan | Charge Time | Maintenance |
|---------------|------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Gas | $10,000–$13,000 | 20–30 years | few Minutes | High |
| Electric | $9,000–$11,000 | 10–15 years | 8–12 hours | Low |
| Renewable (Solar) | Electric base cost + $300–$700 solar | Solar panels: 20–25 years, batteries: 8–20 years | Continuous charge in sunlight | Very Low |

Data compiled from [5], [6], [7].

### Battery Technologies
There are multiple different kinds of batteries used to power a golf car. The most popular in new cars being sold today are lithium-ion batteries. The most widely used across the existing fleet, however, is the lead-acid battery, as decades of older cars remain in service. There are three kinds of lead-acid batteries — flooded, gel, and absorbed glass mat (AGM). Flooded lead-acid batteries are the most affordable and widely used in golf cars, but they require regular maintenance such as checking water levels and cleaning terminals. Gel batteries feature a silica-based gel electrolyte, providing excellent deep-cycle performance, resistance to extreme temperatures, and maintenance-free operation, though they are more expensive and have specific charging needs. AGM batteries use fiberglass mats to absorb the electrolyte, making them spill-proof, vibration-resistant, and lower-maintenance than flooded types while offering similar sealed advantages [2], [3].
The last kind is the nickel-based battery. Nickel-based batteries never really gained a strong foothold in the golf car market specifically. While they found success in other applications like hybrid automobiles and power tools, golf car manufacturers largely skipped over them and went from lead-acid directly to lithium-ion [4]. Below is a comparison of these battery types.


#### Comparison of Golf Car Batteries
|Battery Type |	Full Set Cost (2026) | Lifespan | Charge Time |	Maintenance |
|-------------|----------------------|----------|-------------|-------------|
|Flooded Lead-Acid | $800–$1,500 | 4–6 years | 8–12 hrs | High |
|Gel Lead-Acid | $1,000–$1,800 | 5–7 years | 8–10 hrs |	Low |
|AGM Lead-Acid | $1,200–$2,000 | 5–7 years | 6–8 hrs |	Low |
|Lithium (LiFePO4) | $2,000–$5,000 | 10–20 years | 2–4 hrs | None |
|Nickel-Metal Hydride |	$1,800–$3,500 |	5–8 years | 8–12 hrs |	Medium |
Data compiled from [2], [3], [4].

## Specific Implications - Alec

**Explain the implications of solving the problem for the customer. After reading this section, the reader should understand the tangible benefits and the worthiness of the proposed work.**
- The document must explain how the customer will benefit from the solution.

This project provides LaniEV with a documented application of their retrofit kit for an existing electric Club Car. It also serves as a reference for future evaluations or conversions of similar golf cars by documenting the pre-conversion features of the TTU Club Car and following a structured conversion process. Documentation of the conversion includes battery removal, LiFePO₄ installation, wiring changes, and solar roof installation. This establishes standard procedures that support large-scale conversions. The project includes analysis of energy use, charging behavior, and "fill versus drain" rates. This verified data allows for an objective comparison between old lead-acid systems and the LiFePO₄ solar-integrated system. The resulting performance metrics enhance product credibility and support its large-scale adoption. 

The project also gives LaniEV an analysis of environmental and economic impacts. Comparisons between the pre-conversion and post-conversion golf cars will highlight measurable differences like landfill waste, stress on the electrical grid, carbon footprint, and return on investment. The findings from these comparisons could apply to larger fleet adoption and improve LaniEV's chances of engaging big organizations. Overall, the project builds the technical analysis required for new electric technology and provides LaniEV with an honest, analytical assessment of the retrofit kit.

## Broader Implications, Ethics, and Responsibility as Engineers - George

The capabilities of solar-powered club cars and what they would do for the world
would extend beyond the golf course. By creating a club car that can run on renewable
energy completely, effectively, and efficiently, the world would see an uptick in uses for
these vehicles in the everyday life of mankind. This section will detail the impacts such an
innovation would have on a global, economic, environmental, and societal scale, as well as
detail its potential negatives and ethical responsibilities that must be considered by the
engineers behind this project.

1. Global Impacts:

    On a global scale, the use of solar powered club cars would be seen everywhere
throughout the world in scenarios that would not involve walking or cars. These club cars
would become more common in everyday use to travel small distances in a quick and easy
manner. Some examples of places would be in neighborhoods, large school campuses,
industrial sites, airports, and retirement communities. All these places would be affected
by solar powered club cars in a positive way.

2. Economic Impacts:

    On an economic scale, a solar powered club car that is affordable and efficient
would create increased demand for materials as well as intellectual innovations regarding
renewable energy. An increase in demand for these vehicles would create an increase in
the need for solar panels and batteries to be produced. This would increase the need for
materials such as lithium, nickel, graphite, glass, aluminum, and silicon. An increase in
jobs to meet this increased need for materials would be created so there would be an
increase in those who would mine these materials. There would also be an increase in jobs
created to help with the shipment of these materials, so an increase in jobs to help
accomplish this would also be created.

3. Environmental Impacts:

    The environmental impacts of the solar powered club car could be seen in two
different ways: large scale and small scale. On a larger scale, an increase in pollution
would be created from the increase in materials being mined. On a smaller scale, the areas
that would see an increase in use of these vehicles would experience cleaner air and less
pollution locally. A quality of life improvement that would be seen from the more common use 
use of solar powered club cars would be the amount of noise pollution. There would be significantly
less noise pollution in areas that would see more use in these club cars, because electric
vehicles tend to run much quieter than gas powered cars. 

4. Societal Impacts:
    
    On a societal level, there would be an increase in intellectual innovations regarding
the technologies used by such vehicles. This would include the desire to create solar
panels and batteries that are more efficient. The desire to make batteries live longer, in both
their charge and lifetime, would see a lot of work put into researching these matters on an
industrial scale. Regarding the places that these club cars would be seen more, such as large campuses,
retirement homes, industrial sites, etc., there would be improved mobility for elderly or disabled people. 
There would also be improved transportation of tools and other materials.

5. Potential Negatives:

    Negatives to the use of solar powered club cars would also need to be considered. The environmental
issues that would arise from the increased excavation of materials required for the club car batteries
is no small problem. The amount of hazardous waste that would be created by the increased use of 
batteries would also be a problem, as there is no current viable method to recycle lithium ion 
batteries. Mitigations to these problems would be to choose chemistries of batteries that would have
a reduction in constrained materials, as well as properly informing customers as to how to properly
dispose of used batteries.

6. Ethical Considerations:

    As engineers, it is our responsibility to create a solar powered club car that is not only safe,
but also high quality and honest. All designs and specifications must adhere to legal safety standards. 
It is important that the customer would always understand both the positives and negatives. It would
be our responsibility to list any specifications in regards to safety as well limitations regarding the 
products range or efficiency, so as to reduce the number of injuries or unhappy customers. It is imperative 
not to exaggerate the club cars capabilities, especially in non-ideal conditions.
