## Introduction

The introduction must be the opening section of the proposal. It acts as the "elevator pitch" of the project, briefly introducing the objective, its importance, and the proposed solution. Because readers may only read this section, it should effectively capture their attention and encourage them to read further.

Toward the end of the introduction, include a subsection that outlines what the proposal will cover. This helps set reader expectations for the ensuing sections.


## Formulating the Problem

Formulating the problem or objective involves clearly defining it through background information, specifications, and constraints. Think of it as "fencing in" the objective to make it unambiguously clear what is and is not being addressed and why.

Questions to consider:
- Who does the problem affect (i.e. who is your customer)? This solution targets owners of electric golf carts who wish to supplement their vehicle’s power supply through solar energy, eliminating dependence on traditional outlet-based charging. The intended customer is any electric golf cart owner seeking a more autonomous and flexible charging solution.
  
- Why do we need this solution? This solution addresses a critical gap in usability – when a golf cart’s battery is depleted during active use and no electrical outlet is accessible, the vehicle becomes inoperable. By integrating a solar charging panel, the cart can passively recharge while stationary and exposed to sunlight, extending operational range and reducting downtime without requiring access to traditional charging infrastructure.
  
- What challenges necessitate a dedicated, multi-person engineering team?   Several factors make a multi-person engineering team essential. First, safety oversight cannot be managed by a single individual who is simultaneously performing hands-on-testing – a dedicated team member should always monitor for hazards. Second, the system comprises multiple distinct subsystems, each requiring specialized technical knowledge that no single engineer is likely to possess across all areas. Third, live testing demands the simultaneous collection of data across multiple points in the system, which is physically impossible for one person to manage alone.
  
- Why aren’t off-the-shelf solutions sufficient? While prior attempts have been made to develop a comparable solution, none have proven successful or reliable. Existing commercial products lack the specific compatibility, performance validation, and system integration required for this application, making a purpose-built, thoroughly tested solution necessary. 

### Background

Provide context and details necessary to define the problem clearly and delineate its boundaries.

### Specifications and Constraints

Specifications and constraints define the system's requirements. They can be positive (do this) or negative (don't do that). They can be mandatory (shall or must) or optional (may). They can cover performance, accuracy, interfaces, or limitations. Regardless of their origin, they must be unambiguous and impose measurable requirements.

#### Specifications

Specifications are requirements imposed by **stakeholders** to meet their needs. If a specification seems unattainable, it is necessary to discuss and negotiate with the stakeholders.

#### Constraints

Constraints often stem from governing bodies, standards organizations, and broader considerations beyond the requirements set by stakeholders.

Questions to consider:
- Do governing bodies regulate the solution in any way? Yes, there are sever regulatory bodies that may govern aspects of this solution. The National Electrical Code, Particular Artical 690, sets standards for solar photovoltaic systems and would apply to the electrical integration of the solar panel and charge controller.UL Additionally, if the golf car is intended for use on public roads or pathways, local Department of Motor Vehicles regulations or municipal ordinances may apply. OSHA regulations would also govern safe practices during live testing and assembly to protect team members working with electrical systems.
  
- Are there industrial standards that need to be considered and followed? Several industrial standards are relevent to this project. IEEE standards for battery charging systems provided guidance on safe and efficient energy transfer to lead-acid or lithium-ion battery packs commony found in electric golf carts. ICE 61215 and ICE 61730 cover the performance and safty requirements for photovoltaic modules ensuring the solar panael slected meets durability and output reliability benchmarks. SAE Internation standsrds may also apply regarding the electrical integration of auxiliary power systems into electric vehicales. Adhering to these standards ensures the system performs predictably and safely across varing environmental conditions.
  
- What impact will the engineering, manufacturing, or final product have on public health, safety, and welfare? The engineering and testing phases carry inherent electrical hazards, including rish of shock, short circuit or thermal runwawy in battery systems, which is preciwsely why the project requires a dedicated safety monitor during live testing. The final product,however, has a net positive impact on public safety and welfare by reducing reliance on grid-base charging infrastructure and eleiminating the risk of a stranded,inoperable car in environments where help may not be readily available, such as large private properties, agriculture lands, or remote recrational areas. From a welfare standpoint, increased vehicle autonomy inproves accessibility for users who do not have convenient access to electical outlets. Manufacturing considerations should include responsible sourcing of photovoltaic materials and proper disposal protocols for battery components to minimize environmental health risk.
  
- Are there global, cultural, social, environmental, or economic factors that must be considered? Environmentally, solar integration directly reduces the carbhon footpront associated with golf cars operation by decreasing dependence on grid electricity, which in many regions is still partially generated from fossil fuels. This aligns with broader global sustainability goals and growing demand for clean energy alternatives. Economically, while the upfront cost of solar components represents an added investment, the long term reduction in electricity costs and increased operational flexibility offer a compelling return on investment,particularly for users in high-sunlight regions. Socially, this solution democratizes access to reliable electric transportation in areas lacking adequate electrical infrastructure, which has meaningful implications in rural or developing communities where golf carts serve practical transportation roles beyond recreation. Culturally, the growing acceptance of solar technology and green energy solutions means this product aligns well with current consumer values and expectations around sustainability.

## Survey of Existing Solutions

Research existing solutions, whether in literature, on the market, or within the industry. Present these findings in a coherent, organized manner. Remember to cite all information that is not common knowledge.


## Measures of Success

Define how the project’s success will be measured. This involves explaining the experiments and methodologies to verify that the system meets its specifications and constraints.


## Resources

Each project proposal must include a comprehensive description of the necessary resources.

### Budget

Provide a budget proposal with justifications for expenses such as software, equipment, components, testing machinery, and prototyping costs. This should be an estimate, not a detailed bill of materials.

### Personel

Identify the skills present in the team and compare them to those required to complete the project. Address any skill gaps with a plan to acquire the necessary knowledge.

Besides the team, also state who you choose to be you supervisor and why.

State who your instrucotr is and what role you expect them to play in the project.

### Timeline

Provide a detailed timeline, including all major deadlines and tasks. This should be illustrated with a professional Gantt chart.


## Specific Implications

Explain the implications of solving the problem for the customer. After reading this section, the reader should understand the tangible benefits and the worthiness of the proposed work.


## Broader Implications, Ethics, and Responsibility as Engineers

Consider the project’s broader impacts in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts. Identify potential negative impacts and propose mitigation strategies. Detail the ethical considerations and responsibilities each team member bears as an engineer.


## References

All sources used in the project proposal that are not common knowledge must be cited. Multiple references are required.


## Statement of Contributions

Each team member must contribute meaningfully to the project proposal. In this section, each team member is required to document their individual contributions to the report. One team member may not record another member's contributions on their behalf. By submitting, the team certifies that each member's statement of contributions is accurate.
