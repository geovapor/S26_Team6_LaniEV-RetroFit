# Lani Solar Partnership: Self-Sustaining, Renewable Energy Vehicle 

## Executive Summary

Give the elevator pitch and abstract for the project. It should allow interested visitors to broadly understand the motivation for the project and what the project has accomplished.


## Capabilities

Here explain in more detail (though not as much as will be given in the datasheet) what the version of this project in this repo is capable of doing.


## Salient Outcomes

Projects often have some outcomes that are more interesting than others. Here, highlight those things that you found interesting!


## Project Demonstration & Images

Give a link to a video of the project being demonstrated. The video should be hosted on the capstone youtube.

Below the video link show some well-taken, appropriately sized images of the project.


## About Us

### Team
Give a brief bio for each team member and their broad contribution to the project (no need to be terribly specific).

#### Alec Snodgrass 
Alec Snodgrass is a senior double major in Electrical Engineering and Physics serving as the team lead for this capstone project. He is responsible for project management, external communication with the industry sponsor, and oversight of subsystems integration. His prior physics research capstone experience contributes to structured experimental design, data analysis, and methodology development. In addition to managerial responsibilities, he maintains equal technical contribution. His prior military leadership experience informs his organizational approach and accountability standards in managing a multi-member engineering team.

#### George Vaporis  
George Vaporis is a senior at Tennessee Technological University majoring in Electrical Engineering. He is responsible for completing all tasks assigned in a manner of good quality and timeliness. He has previous experience in working in group projects that have involved coding, building, and information gathering and analysis, giving him the necessary experience to complete any tasks assigned for this project.

### Stakeholders
Tell a bit about the customer for the project. Also discuss any other groups (specific or general) that are expected to be impacted by the project.

The primary customer for this project is Lani Electric Vehicles (LaniEV), a subsidiary of Lani Solar, LLC. Lani Solar develops solar-integrated mobility platforms and energy solutions intended to reduce grid dependence and lifecycle operating costs in light electric vehicle applications. LaniEV is developing standardized retrofit conversion kits for low-speed electric vehicles (LSVs), personal transportation vehicles (PTVs), and golf cars that replace legacy lead-acid battery systems with LiFePO₄ battery banks integrated with solar charging capability. The company’s objective is to enable scalable fleet conversions by providing a structured and repeatable retrofit platform supported by validated engineering documentation.

Secondary stakeholders include organizations that utilize LSV fleets, such as golf resorts, hotels, universities, airports, and industrial plants. Organizations such as these rely on LSVs for day-to-day logistics and are directly affected by reliability, lifecycle cost, and maintenance requirements. Formal documentation of the retrofit process and post-conversion performance data provides decision-making support for these stakeholders by enabling informed evaluation of economic and operational impact.
