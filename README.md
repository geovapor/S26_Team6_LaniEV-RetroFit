# Lani Solar Partnership: Self-Sustaining, Renewable Energy Vehicle 

## Executive Summary

Give the elevator pitch and abstract for the project. It should allow interested visitors to broadly understand the motivation for the project and what the project has accomplished.


## Capabilities

Here explain in more detail (though not as much as will be given in the datasheet) what the version of this project in this repo is capable of doing.


## Salient Outcomes

Projects often have some outcomes that are more interesting than others. Here, highlight those things that you found interesting!


## Project Demonstration & Images

Give a link to a video of the project being demonstrated. The video should be hosted on the capstone youtube.

Below the video link show some well-taken, appropriately sized images of the project.


## About Us

### Team
Give a brief bio for each team member and their broad contribution to the project (no need to be terribly specific).

#### Alec Snodgrass 
Alec Snodgrass is a senior double major in Electrical Engineering and Physics serving as the team lead for this capstone project. He is responsible for project management, external communication with the industry sponsor, and oversight of subsystems integration. His prior physics research capstone experience contributes to structured experimental design, data analysis, and methodology development. In addition to managerial responsibilities, he maintains equal technical contribution. His prior military leadership experience informs his organizational approach and accountability standards in managing a multi-member engineering team.

#### George Vaporis  
George Vaporis is a senior at Tennessee Technological University majoring in Electrical Engineering. He is responsible for completing all tasks assigned in a manner of good quality and timeliness. He has previous experience in working in group projects that have involved coding, building, and information gathering and analysis, giving him the necessary experience to complete any tasks assigned for this project.

#### Landon Paul  
Landon Paul is a senior majoring in Electrical Engineering, with a minor in Mathematics. As secretary for this project, his responsibilities include documenting and distributing information for each team meeting. While in high school, Landon graduated Summa Cum Laude with an associate degree in Liberal Arts from Austin Peay State University through the dual enrollment program. He began working for his father’s company at age 12 fulfilling projects for customers such as Country Music Hall of Fame, Tennessee Titans and Taylor Swift. While at Tennessee Tech he has had the privilege to be a tutor, grader and teacher’s assistant.

#### Nathan Galloway 
Nathan Galloway is a senior at Tennessee Technological University pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering with a concentration in power systems. Throughout his academic career, Nathan has developed a strong foundation in power analysis, programming, and hands-on electrical systems work; skills he will bring directly over to this project. In his role, Nathan will be responsible for collecting and analyzing project data, then synthesizing his findings into a clear, well organized, and professional document. He will also contribute to the hands-on restoration of the golf car, working to return it to fully operational condition.

#### Parker Branson
Parker Branson is a senior in Electrical Engineering and has a associates degree in mathmatics and physics. My main focus is in power systems and my contribution to the project will be to bring in knowlege to the team to help complet task and while ensuring to carry my full share of the responsibilities we take on as a group and also hands on work with the golf car. Parker is experenced in electrical wiring, excel, C++, sodering, LTspice.

### Stakeholders
Tell a bit about the customer for the project. Also discuss any other groups (specific or general) that are expected to be impacted by the project.

The primary customer for this project is Lani Electric Vehicles (LaniEV), a subsidiary of Lani Solar, LLC. Lani Solar develops solar-integrated mobility platforms and energy solutions intended to reduce grid dependence and lifecycle operating costs in light electric vehicle applications. LaniEV is developing standardized retrofit conversion kits for low-speed electric vehicles (LSVs), personal transportation vehicles (PTVs), and golf cars that replace legacy lead-acid battery systems with LiFePO₄ battery banks integrated with solar charging capability. The company’s objective is to enable scalable fleet conversions by providing a structured and repeatable retrofit platform supported by validated engineering documentation.

Secondary stakeholders include organizations that utilize LSV fleets, such as golf resorts, hotels, universities, airports, and industrial plants. Organizations such as these rely on LSVs for day-to-day logistics and are directly affected by reliability, lifecycle cost, and maintenance requirements. Formal documentation of the retrofit process and post-conversion performance data provides decision-making support for these stakeholders by enabling informed evaluation of economic and operational impact.
